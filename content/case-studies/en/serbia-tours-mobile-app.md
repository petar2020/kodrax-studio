The goal was to give Serbia Tours passengers a native mobile channel that matched the reliability of the existing web platform while adding mobile-specific features.

## What was implemented

- Cross-platform React Native app built with Expo for iOS and Android from a single codebase.
- Real-time schedule display with offline caching for areas with poor connectivity.
- Mobile ticket purchase with integrated payment and digital ticket QR codes.
- Push notification system for departure reminders, delays, and promotional offers.
- Saved routes and recent searches for faster rebooking.

## Business impact

The mobile app opened a new sales channel that captured travelers who previously abandoned the desktop site on mobile. Push notifications drove repeat bookings and the native experience significantly improved customer satisfaction scores.
