Prostor Miljenko Dereta is a cultural space in Belgrade that needed its website to match the quality of its mission. The site had become a liability rather than an asset.

## What was implemented

- Full site rebuild using native WordPress Gutenberg blocks instead of heavy page builders.
- Image optimization pipeline with WebP conversion and lazy loading.
- Server-side caching configuration for fast repeat visits.
- Complete technical SEO overhaul: structured data, Open Graph, sitemaps, canonical URLs.
- Mobile-first responsive design ensuring fast rendering on all devices.

## Business impact

The rebuilt site loads in under a second on mobile, passes all Core Web Vitals, and organic traffic grew 180% within two months. The non-profit can now manage content through Gutenberg without developer assistance.
