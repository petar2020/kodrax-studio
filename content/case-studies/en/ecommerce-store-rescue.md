This is a fictionalized case study based on common WordPress rescue patterns used on real projects.

## Recovery scope

- Emergency stabilization for checkout and plugin conflicts.
- Theme-level performance refactor instead of adding more optimization plugins.
- Data and SEO-safe rollout plan to avoid ranking volatility.
- Tracking cleanup to restore reliable conversion analytics.

## Outcome summary

The store moved from reactive maintenance to a stable baseline where marketing spend could scale with less technical risk.
