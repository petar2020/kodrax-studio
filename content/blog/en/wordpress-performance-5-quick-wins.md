When sites feel slow, teams often assume they need a full migration. In many cases, these five fixes recover most of the speed.

## 1. Remove plugin overlap

Multiple plugins doing caching, optimization, or security tasks can conflict and add overhead.

## 2. Convert oversized media

Compress legacy JPG/PNG assets and serve modern formats where possible. Hero media usually has the biggest impact.

## 3. Add page and object caching

A stable caching layer can reduce PHP and database pressure dramatically on traffic spikes.

## 4. Tune Core Web Vitals bottlenecks

Delay non-critical scripts, optimize fonts, and reduce render blocking CSS to improve LCP and INP.

## 5. Audit hosting limits

If CPU, memory, and I/O are saturated, software tuning alone will plateau quickly.

Most teams can apply these changes in a short sprint and measure improvement immediately.
